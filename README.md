## Rules:
1. Game is like space invaders. Enemy ships will keep falling from the sky like 'tetris' at a slower pace.
2. Our ship will be at the bottom with a laser turret.

## Ship's capabilites -
1. One iota of laser will kaboom one pixel square areas of the enemy ship.
2. Firing speed can be altered.
3. The kaboom range can be altered.
4. The ship size and speed can be altered. Size can be proportional to the speed of the ship. You get to choose?
5. Type of ships.

## Enemy ship's capabilities - 
1. Simple: One hit one kill.
2. Extended: Player's ship has some health?
3. Degree of freedom is one in the beginning.

## Type of enemy ships - 
1. Small zombie thug ships, slow rate of fire (RoF) but large in number. High probability of spawning.
2. Mid size thug ships with larger turrets.
3. Extended: Boss ship with humongous size and multiple turrets ? Slow movement.
4. Simple: The enemy can be of various sizes? Round? Shapeless.

## Arena or game environment -
1. Simple: We can fix the player's ship and change the environment, enemies keep piling up like tetris.
2. Extended version (DLC?!): The player ship has four degree of freedoms and it can score points based on the number of enemy ships it wrecks!
3. Extended: Space mines? Environmental factors which can be used.

# MISC -
1. Player stats, high score!
2. Number of ships (lives).
