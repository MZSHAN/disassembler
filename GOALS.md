# GOALS
1. Draw player ships and move it 
using WASD keys.
2. Draw enemy ships likewise but
with random 
movement.

arguments to functions !!

pusha - popd fucks up

Stream day 11 - incbin bin code is overwritten somehow
Stream day 14 - stop drawable overflow from the boundary
Stream day 15 - draw enemy and try collision

# OFF stream stuff
1. Install bochs
2. Show navigatable upto date code of IO buffer for viewers

# Lesson Learned
overflow of times data - go through entire codebase, other bootloader files too!!
bullet indexing - RTFM clearly!!
